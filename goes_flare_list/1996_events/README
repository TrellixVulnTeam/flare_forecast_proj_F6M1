This directory contains Edited Events lists from
May 28, 1995 through December 31, 1995.

Starting Jan 1996 - the event filename also
contain the year. 


                          SOLAR EVENT LISTS

This directory contains daily preliminary lists of solar events. The solar 
event reports that are received at SEC throughout the day are edited by the 
duty forecaster to remove incomplete and duplicate reports. This list contains 
one line for each event observed. The list is written into this directory after
the end of the day, usually near 0400 UT on the next day. A subset of each 
list (the "energetic" events) is included in the daily "Solar Geophysical 
Activity Summary (SGAS)" report and the "Energetic Events" list in SEC's 
WEEKLY publication.

This sample list shows typical event reports. The format is fixed, 
80 columns wide, with standard headers. The fields are described below. 

If no events are reported the following line is shown:
     NO EVENTS REPORTED

The second line of the list indicates the date/time the list was created. This 
is usually near 0400 UT the next day; otoherwise it indicates only that the
program was rerun for some reason.

EDITED EVENTS for "date" - the UT date of the event reports (only one UT day
per list).

Event - This is an arbitrary event number assigned by SEL. It groups several
        reports into a single event, as determined by the SEL forecaster.
+     - A plus sign (+) after the event number indicates that more than one 
        report was received for this event, and the forecaster has selected 
        this report to represent those received. 

Begin, Max, End  - 
        The UT Time (UT) of the beginning, maximum, and end of the event as 
        reported by the observing site. "////" indicates a missing time. The 
        UT day of the event's begin time is the UT day of the list. The UT day 
        of the maximum and/or end times may or may not be the same as the begin 
        time. Most solar events are several hours in duration. If the maximum 
        or end time is less than the begin time, then assume the times are for 
        the next UT day.

        The begin time of an x-ray event is defined as the first minute, in a 
        sequence of 4 minutes, of steep monotonic increase in 0.1-0.8 nm flux. 
        The x-ray event maximum is taken as the minute of the peak x-ray flux. 
        The end time is the time when the flux level decays to a point halfway 
        between the maximum flux and the pre-flare background level. 

Obs   - The reporting observatory.
        CUL - Culgoora, Australia     GO7, GO8, GO9 - GOES 7, 8, or 9 satellites

Q     - Quality
        For radio bursts at fixed and sweep frequencies, and for storms, this 
        shows the quality of the data
                       C = Corrected report
                       G = Good 
                       U = Uncertain
        For optical flares, this shows the quality of observing conditions, 
        from 1 to 5, where:  1 = very poor and 5 = excellent
        
        X-ray events have a quality of 5 (meaning excellent).

Type  - Type of report, (see the Glossary in the "Welcome" directory for 
        definitions). 
          BSL = Bright surge on the limb
          DSF = Filament disappearance
          EPL = Eruptive prominence on the limb
          FIL = Filament
          FLA = Optical flare observed in H-alpha 
          FOR = Forbush decrease (cosmic ray decrease))
          GLE = Ground-level event (cosmic ray increase)
          LPS = Loop prominence system
          PCA = Polar cap absorption
          RBR = Fixed-frequency radio burst
          RNS = Radio Noise Storm
          RSP = Sweep-frequency radio burst
          XRA = X-ray flare

Loc/Frq - Location or frequency.
	Location is in degrees latitude, north or south, and degrees longitude,
        east or west, from central meridian. The location is the spherical, 
        heliographic coordinates of the solar region, as a distance in degrees 
        from a line extending from the solar equator (heliographic latitude), 
        and distance in degrees from a line extending from the north solar 
        rotational pole to the south solar rotational pole through the center 
        of the solar disk, as viewed from Earth (central meridian) in H-alpha.

        Frequencies are in Mhz.

Particulars - Additional information from the report, chosen on the basis of 
        the report type.


   XRA: X-ray Class
           Class           x = peak flux in the 0.1 to 0.8 nm range

	Integrated flux from start to end, in joules m E-2.

   FLA: Importance and brightness
  	    Importance is the corrected area of the flare in heliospheric 
            square degrees at maximum brightness, observed in the H-alpha 
            line (656.3 nm).
	       S - Subflare (area < or =2.0 square degrees).
	       1 - Importance 1  ( 2.1 <= area <=  5.1 square degrees)
    	       2 - Importance 2  ( 5.2 <= area <= 12.4 square degrees)
	       3 - Importance 3  (12.5 <= area <= 24.7 square degrees)
	       4 - Importance 4  (        area >= 24.8 square degrees)

	    Brightness is the relative maximum brightness of flare in H-alpha.
 	       F - faint	N - normal	B - brilliant

        Other comments:
            ERU - Eruptive

   RBR:
	The peak value above pre-burst background of associated 
	radio bursts at frequencies of 245 and 2695 MHz: 
	1 flux unit = 10-22 Wm-2 Hz-1

   RSP:
	The intensity is a relative scale from 1 (low) to 3 (high) of 
	any sweep radio event associated with the energetic event, as follows 
	
	Type II: Slow drift burst
	Type III: Fast drift burst
	Type IV: Broadband smooth continuum burst 
	Type V: Brief continuum burst, generally associated with Type III 
		bursts
	Type CTM: Long-lived dekametric continuum associated with storms of
                  Type IV bursts
